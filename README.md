 CSS Styles and Their Application

Resetting Default Browser Styles: The CSS file begins with a reset to remove any default margin, padding, and box-sizing properties from all elements. This ensures a consistent starting point for styling across different browsers.
Body Styles: The body element is styled to set the font family, background color, line height, and text color for the entire webpage.
Header Styles: The header element is styled with a dark background color, white text color, and padding to create a visually appealing header section. The navigation links (nav) within the header are styled to display inline with no bullet points and some margin between them. The links are styled with white text color and no underline.
Navigation Styles: The navigation bar (nav) is styled with a background color and padding to distinguish it from the rest of the header. The links within the navigation bar have a consistent style, maintaining uniformity across all pages.
Main Content Styles:
Review Section: Reviews are styled with a border, padding, and margin to separate them from other content. Each review may have its own unique style, such as a background color or border style, to differentiate them visually.
Blog Section: Blog posts are styled with appropriate spacing, typography, and possibly a background color or border to distinguish them. Images within blog posts may have styles applied to ensure they fit well within the content area.
