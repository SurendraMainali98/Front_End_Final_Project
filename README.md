 CSS Styles and Their Application

Resetting Default Browser Styles: The CSS file begins with a reset to remove any default margin, padding, and box-sizing properties from all elements. This ensures a consistent starting point for styling across different browsers.
Body Styles: The body element is styled to set the font family, background color, line height, and text color for the entire webpage.
Header Styles: The header element is styled with a dark background color, white text color, and padding to create a visually appealing header section. The navigation links (nav) within the header are styled to display inline with no bullet points and some margin between them. The links are styled with white text color and no underline.
Navigation Styles: The navigation bar (nav) is styled with a background color and padding to distinguish it from the rest of the header. The links within the navigation bar have a consistent style, maintaining uniformity across all pages.
Main Content Styles:
Review Section: Reviews are styled with a border, padding, and margin to separate them from other content. Each review may have its own unique style, such as a background color or border style, to differentiate them visually.
Blog Section: Blog posts are styled with appropriate spacing, typography, and possibly a background color or border to distinguish them. Images within blog posts may have styles applied to ensure they fit well within the content area.
Contact Form Section: The contact form is styled with appropriate input field styles, such as border, padding, and margin, to ensure user input fields are easily identifiable. The form may have a background color or border to visually separate it from other content.
Products Section: Product listings are styled with consistent spacing, typography, and possibly a grid layout for better presentation. Each product may have its own style, such as a hover effect or border, to enhance user interaction.
Footer Styles: The footer element is styled with a dark background color, white text color, and padding to create a footer section consistent with the header design.
Application to Pages

Home Page: The styles for navigation, reviews, blogs, contact form, and product sections are applied to relevant areas on the home page, providing a cohesive design and user experience.
Products Page: Each section on the Services page utilizes appropriate styles for navigation, reviews, blogs, contact form, and product listings, maintaining a uniform appearance and user experience.
Blog page : Similar application of styles is seen on the Blog page, ensuring consistency in design across different sections of the website.
Details Page: Similar application of styles is seen on the products page, ensuring consistency in design across different sections of the website.
Contact-Us Page: The Contact Us page incorporates styles for the navigation bar, contact form, and possibly reviews or testimonials, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all pages.




Challenges and Solutions

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring that the styles render consistently across different web browsers was a challenge. This was addressed by testing the website on multiple browsers and making adjustments as needed to achieve a consistent appearance.
Responsive Design: Creating styles that adapt well to various screen sizes posed a challenge. 
This was tackled by using relative units like percentages and ems for sizing and 
employing media queries to adjust styles for different viewport widths.
This report provides an overview of the CSS styles used in the project and how they are applied to the pages, 
along with addressing some challenges encountered during the development process.
Consistency: Ensuring consistent styling across different sections of the website was a challenge. 
This was addressed by creating a style guide and adhering to it throughout the development process.
User Experience: Designing styles that enhance the user experience, especially in sections like product listings and contact forms, required careful consideration of layout, typography, and interaction. 
This was achieved through iterative design and usability testing.
